Collaborating with a prestigious insurance company in Tunisia, our team conducted an in-depth hashtag#risk_assessment, analyzing the hashtag#duration of their assets and liabilities. This allowed us to understand their sensitivity to interest rate changes and identify the best hashtag#hedging strategy.

We designed a tailored hashtag#swap_contract to neutralize the identified risks. 
This contract was meticulously crafted to align with the company’s financial needs and hashtag#risk_profile. 

Presenting this solution to a bank, along with a hashtag#PowerBI dashboard summarizing the key metrics extracted from the analysis, we engaged in detailed discussions, ensuring clarity and practicality in our proposal.

After successful hashtag#negotiations on pricing, we reached an agreement that benefited both the bank and the insurance company. The finalized proposal was well-received, ready to be implemented to effectively mitigate their interest rate risk.

This work was a joint effort with my teammates jihen gazzeh, aoui malek, and Nour Elloumi. Their dedication and invaluable contributions were crucial in tackling the project’s challenges.
