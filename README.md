Collaborating with a prestigious insurance company in Tunisia, our team conducted an in-depth  risk_assessment, analyzing the  duration of their assets and liabilities. This allowed us to understand their sensitivity to interest rate changes and identify the best  hedging strategy.

We designed a tailored  swap_contract to neutralize the identified risks. 
This contract was meticulously crafted to align with the company’s financial needs and  risk_profile. 

Presenting this solution to a bank, along with a  PowerBI dashboard summarizing the key metrics extracted from the analysis, we engaged in detailed discussions, ensuring clarity and practicality in our proposal.

After successful  negotiations on pricing, we reached an agreement that benefited both the bank and the insurance company. The finalized proposal was well-received, ready to be implemented to effectively mitigate their interest rate risk.

This work was a joint effort with my teammates jihen gazzeh, aoui malek, and Nour Elloumi. Their dedication and invaluable contributions were crucial in tackling the project’s challenges.
